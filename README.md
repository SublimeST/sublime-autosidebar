# Sublime AutoSidebar

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Up to Sublime Text 4 (build 4152), the sidebar state is remembered globally. If you disable it for some window, the following opened windows will have it opened.

Normally, this is no problem except when using Sublime Text as your main text editor: opening a single file always opens the sidebar if you had it enabled. And opening a project will have the sidebar closed if you closed it before.

This plugin makes the sidebar appear and disappear automatically based in the following conditions:

- If there is any folder opened, show the toolbar.
- If multiple files are opened, and tabs are disabled (using probably instead the `View -> Sidebar -> Open files` feature), show the sidebar.
- Else don't show the sidebar.

Hopefully, this plugin will eliminate the need to manually show and hide the sidebar.
